How computer ai works computer science hw
In Computers they use a system called system classification, this is when a program sees and image and is able to group it into a category and know what it is this is projected as a rectangle on the object it recognised what it is by name and how big it is. this model is also expandable so it can be used in tracking live video and you could update the position and the contents of the box numerous times per second, this could be used in apirports to more safely check through baggage as on top of a human search that could flag something pottentionaly dangerous that could be mistaken due to human error, this could also be used to be able to flag content on entertainment sights such as youtube if any content that goes against their rules and regulations, instead of going through billions of videos they could create an ai that automatically detects it and take it down
